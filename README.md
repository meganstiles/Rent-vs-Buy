# Rent-vs-Buy
Is it cheaper to rent or buy a primary residence?

### Every one says BUY BUY BUY!
Almost anyone you ask, will tell you that you must buy property and that if you rent you are simply THROWING money away! But is that really true? Certainly, there are certain markets that appreciate rapidly where you can make some serious money on your property. But if the appreciation is low (<1% a year), is it really cheaper to buy than to rent?

As someone interesting in owning a home I am trying to figure that out. Most online calculators that calculated whether it is better to rent or buy, in my opinion, fail to account for a few costs:

1. **The cost to sell the home:** You cannot capitalize on the increase in value until you sell. Right now realators hold a monopoloy on this, charging sellers 6% of the sales price (although it is naive to think that the buy does not ultimately pay this, for simplicity, I calculate it when you sell)

2. **Opportunity Cost of other investments:** A good mutual fund can get you 7-10% and even a bank account will currently pay over 2%. This means there is a cost to dumping money into your house if that house doesn't beat this appreciation.

3. **Maintaince/Upgrades:** Conventional wisdom says you should expect to pay 1% of your home value each year on maintaince, however this can obviously vary widely and from year to year.
